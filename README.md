# secbrowser [NOT READY FOR USE]

A simple interface to interact with SEC filings. Part of [datamule](https://github.com/john-friedman/datamule-python).

## Why this was made

- I needed a good visual interface to improve doc2dict
- I needed a good visual interface to explore nlp
- I wanted to stress test datamule's functionality. This is an opportunity to improve architecture / add useful stuff.

## Why it may be useful for you
- Easier UI
- You like visualizations

## Features TBD
- Download filings from client
- Portfolio page where you can select Submissions. Probably will have nice metadata interface for filtering filings.
- Submission page with xbrl and fundamentals as well as document list
- Document page with text, data, tables, nlp, etc


## Improvements to be made to datamule
- Change how submissions load from list based to hash. O(1).
